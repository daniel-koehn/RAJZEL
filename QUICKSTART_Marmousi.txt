Quickstart to run the Marmousi-II benchmark example in 12 easy steps

Minimum requirements:
---------------------
CPU with 1 - 8 cores
30 MB RAM
10 minutes computation time

C-Compiler: gcc, icc (recommended)
MPI-library: OpenMPI, Intel-MPI (recommended)
other libraries: Fastest Fourier Transform in the West (FFTW) - https://github.com/FFTW/fftw3

Seismic Unix or Matlab or Matplotlib for seismic data and model visualization 

1. Clone RAJZEL on your local machine

git clone https://github.com/daniel-koehn/RAJZEL.git

2. In /src adapt the compiler options in the Makefile to your system and compile the RAJZEL code with

make rajzel

3. Clone DENISE-Benchmark on your local machine 

git clone https://github.com/daniel-koehn/DENISE-Benchmark

4. Copy model file for the Marmousi-II model from DENISE-Benchmark to RAJZEL 

cp DENISE-Benchmark/Marmousi-II/start/marmousi_II_marine.* RAJZEL/par/start/

5. In RAJZEL/par/RAJZEL_marm_OBC.inp check if the following parameters are set correctly  for a forward modelling run

forward_modelling_(yes=0)_FATT_(yes=1)_GRID_SEARCH_(yes=2)_(INVMAT) = 0
READMOD = 1 
MFILE = start/marmousi_II_marine

6. Generate synthetic Marmousi-II data for an OBC acquisition geometry by running RAJZEL on e.g. 8 cores of 
your CPU from the /par directory:

mpirun -np 8 ../bin/rajzel RAJZEL_marm_OBC.inp FATT_workflow_marmousi.inp 

The forward Eikonal solver is parallelized via a shot parallelization. Therefore, the number of MPI processes 
should not exceed the total number of shots. For the given problem 4-8 cores should be sufficient. 

7. For each shot defined in source/source_OBC_VSP.dat the first arrival traveltimes at the receiver positions defined in 
receiver/receiver_OBC.dat are written to 

picked_times/picks_[shotno].dat

If you set SNAP=1 in RAJZEL_marm_OBC.inp traveltime maps for the whole model are written to 

TT/marmousi_shot_[shotno].tt

which can be visualized with Seismic Unix

ximage n1=174 < marmousi_shot_1.tt

8. In RAJZEL/par/picked_times generate the directory marmousi_true

mkdir marmousi_true

9. Move the first arrival traveltime data of the true model from /picked_times to /picked_times/marmousi_true

mv picks_* marmousi_true/

10. To run FATT change the following parameters in RAJZEL/par/RAJZEL_marm_OBC.inp

forward_modelling_(yes=0)_FATT_(yes=1)_GRID_SEARCH_(yes=2)_(INVMAT) = 1
read_model_parameters_from_MFILE(yes=1)(READMOD) = 0
SNAP=0

With the option READMOD = 0 a 1D linear gradient Vp model is defined below the water column by /src/1D_start_marm.c.
Also check if MODEL = 1D_start_marm.c is set in /src/Makefile 

11. Start the 2D FATT with 

mpirun -np 8 ../bin/rajzel RAJZEL_marm_OBC.inp FATT_workflow_marmousi.inp

As defined in FATT_workflow_marmousi.inp the FATT is based on an inversion workflow using Gauss-filtered 
gradients with a filter length of 39 gridpoints in x-direction and 39 gridpoints in y-direction, respectively. 
The filter size is based on the diameter of the first fresnel zone:  

d_fresnel = sqrt(offset_max \lambda_min) = sqrt(offset_max min(vp)/fmax)

with offset_max is the maximum offset of the acquisition geometry, \lambda_min the minimum wavelength, min(vp) the 
minimum P-wave velocity and fmax the maximum frequency which was used to pick the first arrivals. For the Marmousi 
model, I assumed 

min(vp) = 1500 m/s
fmax = 20 Hz
offset_max = 8000 m

leading to a diameter of the first Fresnel zone:

d_fresnel = 775 m

or in terms of grid points:

FILT_SIZE_GRAD = round(d_fresnel / DH) = 39 grid points

with DH = 20.0 m.

To achieve smoother FATT models, the coherence length of the Gaussian filter has to be increased.

The Vp models of the current iteration are saved in:

model/modelTest_vp.bin

12. Depending on the clock speed of your CPU wait approximately  10 minutes ...

The intermediate results after the FATT of each filter stage are saved separatly in  

model/modelTest_vp_stage_1.bin
model/modelTest_vp_stage_2.bin
model/modelTest_vp_stage_3.bin

You can visualize the results with Seismic Unix

ximage n1=174 < model/modelTest_vp_stage_1.bin 

Congratulations, you just finished your first FATT with RAJZEL.
